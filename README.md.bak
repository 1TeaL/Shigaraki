## Deku
Adds Deku from My Hero Academia, a high risk survivor which can boost his stats and skills, in exchange losing health and taking damage from his stronger skills. 
#### Multiplayer works (hopefully).
#### Message me on the Risk of Rain 2 Modding Discord if there are any issues- TeaL#5571.

## Overview
Deku's general game plan is that his base form is safe with range and crowd control but with low damage. Then, when needed, he can use his special (OFA 100%) to increase his damage output and mobility. When at low health he can rely on his passive increased regen in base form to heal up.
Attack speed scales fairly well with him as most skills do scale with it. Aiming to mitigate the health drain costs in OFA 100% mode can also make him very powerful.

## Skills
### Passive
Deku has innate increased health regen the lower his health is. He also has a double jump.
### Primary - Airforce
Shoots a bullet dealing 2 x 100% damage.
### Secondary - Blackwhip
Pulls and stuns enemies in front for 300% damage. Gain barrier if an enemy is hit (based on attack damage). Attack speed increases the pull radius and barrier gain as well.
### Utility - Shoot Style
Dashes and hits enemies for 200% damage multiple times while having invincibility during the attack (Basically mercenary's eviscerate). 
## Special - One For All 100%
Deku's key ability- 100% boosts his Attack speed (1.5x), Damage (2x), Movement speed(1.5x) and Armor(5x) as well as changing all his abilities. This comes at the cost of negative health regen(-8x) and self-damage on his skills.
### Boosted Primary - St. Louis Smash
Dash and hit enemies passed through, dealing ? x 200% damage (Attack speed increases the number of attacks). Have invincibility during the duration. This doesn't cost health.
### Boosted Secondary - Detroit Smash
Charge up a punch that teleports you and does damage and stun on release, dealing a minimum of 600% damage, charging infinitely. Costs 10% of your max health to use. 
### Boosted Utility - Delaware Smash 100%
Send a blast forward, stunning and dealing 600% damage to enemies in front, while sending Deku backwards as well. Costs 10% of your max health to use.

## Numbers
##### Armor = 15 +0.5 per level
##### Damage = 10 + 2 per level
##### Regen = 1 + 0.2 per level (note: increases the lower his health is)
##### Health = 150 + 30 per level
##### Movespeed = 7

These stats are prone to change.
